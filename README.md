Iris is flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their
measurements. 
This dataset is having 5 attributes such as Sepal length, Sepal Width, Petal length , Petal width, and  Species. First thing we need to do is importing python libraries that are essential for Iris flower classification.
Exploratory data analysis is performed on the Iris dataset to clean the data(if null , missing values any). After the data cleaning process the data is visualized using graphs and charts etc.. 
Then the data is splitted into train and test data. A machine learning model is built using the training data to train the models. After the training process model evaluation is done is using several metrics like R-Squared method, Mean Absloute Error etc.. The model with high accuracy and performance is selected as the best model and is used to test .
Finally it is used to find trends and patterns in data. 
This gives clear insights about the data that we have taken.
